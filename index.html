        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is a simple tool for sharing secrets safely with multiple people.</p>

        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a> is a method for splitting a secret, like a password, into pieces.</li>
            <li>Imagine a secret is a puzzle, and you give each trusted person a piece. Only when a certain number of these pieces are put together, the secret is revealed. This ensures that no single person can access the secret alone.</li>
            <li>This tool allows you to split a secret into pieces, and then encode each piece as a QR code. You can then print these QR codes and distribute them to your trusted people. When you need to access the secret, you can scan the QR codes and the secret will be revealed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
            There are scenarios where having only 1 key to decrypt a message is not sufficient and at the same time
            splitting the keys in half might pose risk of loosing such a key.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, you want to encrypt a message and give the decryption key to your family members.
            You want to make sure that if one of them loses the key, the message is still accessible.
            But you don't want to have to collect all the keys every time you want to decrypt the message and at the same time
            you don't want to have to trust any single person with the key.
        </p>
        <h3>How safe is it?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The secret is encrypted using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a> with a random key.</li>
            <li>The key is then split using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a> into multiple pieces. It has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-theoretic_security">Information-theoretic security</a></li>
            <li>The QR codes contain the whole encrypted message, only enough keys are required</li>
            <li><strong>Nothing is stored on the server!</strong> This app runs locally and no webserver is logging the keys (hashtag part of url)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Licence on code</h3>
        <p>The code is licenced under MIT licence. You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/belda/shared_encryption">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <div id="useCasesSection" class="tabcontent">
        <h2>Use-Cases</h2>
        <p>Here are some examples of how this tool can be used.</p>
        <h3>Last Will</h3>
        <p>Imagine you have a secret that you want to share with your family, but only after you die. You can split the secret into 3 pieces, and give each piece to a different family member.
            When you die, your family can scan the QR codes and reveal the secret.</p>
        </p>
        <h3>BitCoin wallet for board members</h3>
        <p>In a larger company you can ensure that certain high value information
        (e.g. key to unlock the company's BTC wallet) is accessed only when majority of
        board members aggree.</p>
        <h3>Failover decryption</h3>
        <p>You can create multiple decryption keys and allow redundancy in case one of the keys gets lost</p>
        <h3>Nuclear Missile Launch Codes</h3>
        <p>Obviously since it is safe enough you can have 2 people confirmation while launching
        nuclear strike.</p>

    <div id="encryptionSection" class="tabcontent">
        <h2>Encrypt</h2>
        <p>In order to safely split your secret into multiple parts, follow these steps.</p>
        <!-- Form for encryption -->
        <form>
          <!-- Input for message -->
          <h3>1. Enter your secret message you wish to encrypt.</h3>
          <div>
            <textarea id="message" name="message" class="messageinput" required placeholder="Write your ASCII meassage to be encrypted here"></textarea>
          </div>
          <!-- Input for number of shares -->
          <h3>2. Enter how you want to split it</h3>
          <p>
            I want to split the secret into
              <input type="number" id="shares" name="shares" required placeholder="num. keys" title="Total number of keys generated">
              keys and require minimum of <input type="number" id="threshold" name="threshold" required placeholder="threshold" title="how many keys is the minimum to decrypt"> keys
              to decrypt the message.
          </p>
          <p class="note">If you have more keys it will still unlock, however with less the information will be lost.</p>

          <!-- Button to generate QR codes -->
          <h3>3. Generate the parts of the key</h3>
          <p>
            <button type="button" id="generateQR" class="large">Generate</button>
          </p>

        </form>

        <!-- Display QR codes -->
        <h3>4. Distribute the keys</h3>
        <p class="note">The keys are generated randomly and are not stored on the server. Transfer them safely using e2e encryption. From here on onwards their ways should be separate.</p>
        <div id="encoded_data"><i>--no keys generated yet--</i></div>
    </div>


    <div id="decryptionSection" class="tabcontent">
        <h2>Decrypt</h2>
        <p>To decrypt the message you have 2 ways. </p>
        <h3>Scan the QR codes</h3>
        <p>Use your mobile phone on available codes and after all are scanned tap decrypt.</p>
        <p class="note">Every time you scan a code it this page opens and stores the code in your browser. Once you have enough codes scanned (threshold) you can press decrypt to get the message.</p>
        <h3>Manual input</h3>
        <p>1. Enter the encrypted message</p>
        <!-- Form for decryption -->
        <form>
          <div>
            <textarea id="encryptedMessage" name="encryptedMessage" class="messageinput" required placeholder="Your encrypted message goes here"></textarea>
          </div>
          <!-- The form sends the user to this page with # and that stores the key in the local storage. then you need to press the decrypt button. -->

          <!-- Input for key -->
          <p>2. Enter key shares one by one and hit load key</p>
          <p>
                <input type="text" id="key" name="key" required placeholder="Enter the key to decrypt">
                <button type="button" id="loadKey">Load Key</button>
